# SQL-Retail-Data-Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This project focuses on using SQL to evaluate a large retail dataset that includes sales transactions, customer information, and product information. The investigation attempts to uncover significant insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making in the retail sector by leveraging SQL's querying capabilities.

Key Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Data exploration and understanding through SQL queries enabling retrieval of specific information from the retail dataset.enable the
Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL functions to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Aggregation and summarization of sales data to calculate key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and customer lifetime value (CLV)
Segmentation of customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
Identification of popular products, top-selling categories, and seasonal trends through SQL queries and aggregations.
Calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer retention rate, purchase frequency, and sales growth.
Joining and merging of multiple tables to analyze relationships between customers, products, and sales.

Skills and Techniques Utilized:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL: Data retrieval, manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and joining.

Data exploration: Understanding the structure and contents of the retail dataset

Data cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.

Aggregations and calculations: Summarizing sales data, calculating metrics, and generating insights.

Customer segmentation: Grouping customers based on behavior and characteristics
